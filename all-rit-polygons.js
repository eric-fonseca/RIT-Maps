This unassuming Rochester woman, whose life never gave evidence of wealth, was anxious that her resources be used constructively and to the greatest possible long-term advantage. She left a percentage of her estate to RIT as an educational grant. That portion turned out to be one of the largest bequests ever made to RIT at the time.  It was this bequest which strongly influenced the decision for RIT to move to the new Henrietta campus in 1968. \n\n<br /><br />\nIn 1959, New York State had announced that it would divide the downtown campus in half, due to the construction of an extension to the expressway's inner loop. Grace Watson's generosity enabled the Institute to buy 1,300 acres of land in Henrietta, a critical factor in facilitating the move. \n\t</p>",

Later, he organized and became president of the Cochrane Bly Co., makers of machine tools.</p>\n\n<p>He served on the Rochester Institute of Technology Board of Trustees from 1910 to 1953 and also held the positions of director, secretary and treasurer. George Clark had a deep interest in the concerns of the Institute, and not only gave generously of his time but was equally as generous with monetary donations.

Early in his career, he became the owner of several small newspapers, some of them in Rochester. Throughout his life he owned or had partial ownership of over 20 different newspapers.<br /><br />In 1922, as president of the New York State Publishers Association, Frank Gannett led in the founding of the Empire State School of Printing in Ithaca, New York.<br /><br />There was a great shortage of trained printers after the First World War. Gannett envisioned a vast program of education and research in the graphic arts field and saw the need to be affiliated with a larger facility. He regarded the Mechanics Institute an excellent technological school, and decided that it would be an ideal place for the printing school to continue its growth. So in 1937 the school was moved, along with 18 students and three instructors.<br /><br />He was a principal benefactor of RIT and served as a trustee from 1938-1957. In 1952, Frank Gannett was the recipient of the Distinguished Founders Award given by the RIT Board of Trustees, in appreciation of his life of service and achievement. \n\t</p>\n",

In 1888, she became the first woman to enroll in Cornell University's Engineering program. She left school before the end of her first year to take a more active part in her father's business. Later, she also studied part-time at the Mechanics Institute.\n\n<br /><br />\nFrom 1890-1913 she served as Secretary-Treasurer to the Gleason Works. Her role as a sales representative allowed her frequent travel throughout the United States and Europe. Upon leaving the Gleason Works in 1913, she acquired a bankrupt machine and tool company. She returned it to profitability and became active with several business ventures in the village of East Rochester, New York.\n<br /><br />\nShe was the only woman member of the American Concrete Institute. In 1914, she became the first woman elected to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In 1916, she became the first woman member of the Rochester Engineering Society.\n\n\t</p>\n",

He served until May of 1863.<br />\n<br />\n\nIn 1885, the Rochester area was a swiftly expanding community whose industrial growth had created a need for skilled workers. The Bausch and Lomb optical company was one of the areas largest and most successful industries. Because John Bausch and Henry Lomb were discouraged by the lack of vocational training available locally, they were motivated to establish a technical institute in Rochester.  Together with Max Lowenthal, Ezra R. Andrews, Frank Ritter, William F. Peck and others, they founded the Mechanics Institute. The mission of the Mechanics Institute was to offer \"education for making a living.\"<br />\n<br />\nCaptain Lomb served as chairman of the Institute Board from 1881-1891, and continued to be a strong supporter of the school until his death in 1908. \n\t</p>\n",

He fought hard for his own education, not knowing any English when he arrived here. He received a bachelor's degree from Gallaudet College and it was this experience that helped shape his views on education for the deaf.\n<br><br>\nHe wrote about his vision in the 1930's but he was virtually unheard.
